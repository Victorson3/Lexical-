#consider the following scenario
y<-5
myfunc<-function(x){
x+y
}
#what happens when we call;
myfunc(4)
#9 is returned. This is because in lexical scoping, the value of y in myfunc is looked up in the environment in which the function was defined.In this case, myfunc was defined in the global environment therefore the value of y is 5
